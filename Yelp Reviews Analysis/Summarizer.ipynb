I was still charged for the wings, and the chickencrap manager didn't have the guts to come out and talk!  They did send a lettuce salad \"on the house\" after I was told the wings would be taken off the bill.  Of course, the wings were not taken off thebill, but the server was nice and I didn't want to create a scene.  I paid, but will not go back to Outback in Chandler, Az!!  Oh, by the way, I spent an hour on the Hershey Highway when I got home!  Unless I get at least an acknowlegement from the manager, I will not go back, and will continue the email campaign against this Outback in Chandler, AZ (located next to the Chandler Mall)!!  \\n\\nIf you go, stay away from those poop inducing wings!!</td>\n",

When i was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes at an unusually young age, I was amazed at the expertise and knowledge, choices and recommendations, and terrific  care.  The office seems also to run very efficiently.\\n\\nThe surgery itself was a breeze, 1 hr of prep, and a 10 minute surgery.  i did one eye per visit, and could see immediately afte, albeit sensitive to light.  Dr Wellish is truly terrific.\\n\\nThe follow-up vists were very accomodating to my schedule, and I am very pleased with my vision now - no glasses and i can see fantastic!\\n\\nOne word of caution: with the choices in lenses, there is a great variance of costs.

Not a single qualm.\\n\\nParking is available via two lots (one off Monroe, the other off Spooner). Carts are always tidy, never massively dumped and sprawled in the parking lots or in the streets. The store is so tidy and well-maintained. Staff are always on top of tasks and helpful, friendly 95% of the time, and many come to recognize you after recurring visits!\\n\\nProduce is decent quality and I always find what I need. Specialty, holiday, and seasonal promotions are always fun too:  pizza crust dough, my summer iced coffee concentrate and winter holiday panettone! YUM!\\n\\nA hidden gem IMHO:  tea tree infused body care items. Body wash. Face scrub. Face/Skin cleansing pads. Oil. I'm drinking the TJ's tea tree kool-aid!\\n\\nI would head local for something like coffee beans, though.   \n",

       "28  Excellent - have not been here in two years, since our last meal was exceptionally Bad. However after being told it's been under new management for over a year and getting positive feedback, we gave it another try. First - the reason I did not give it Five Stars is the Prices. They are approaching High Dining with one appetizer, two dinners and no alcohol near 150 dollars (including tip) for two.\\nWe had the Baby Spinach Salad with Strawberries and caramelized pecans in a house poppy seed dressing (excellent) in nice presentation bowls. The Crab Cake appetizer consisted of chilled crab meat topped with lettuce,tomato and avocado with some excellent sauces. Surprisingly refreshing and unique, but missing the top quality LUMP Crab Meat the dishes price implied. Two Filet's - one Medium the second heavy medium, were both excellently cooked, fork tender, and the wine reduction sauce added a nice flavor.\\nSide orders of Creamed Corn and Loaded Baked Potato were generous and as expected....   \n",
       "29                                    We walked in at 10:40 and sat at a table right next to the bar. Waiters and waitresses walked past us repeatedly and we finally went up to the bar to get our drinks. At 11:02 I went back up to the bar to inquire about getting food and was told they stopped serving at 11 to which I replied to the bartender that we had been sitting at a table right across from her for 20 minutes. She called out somebody's name and I told her not to worry about it cuz I was so pissed off with her attitude she also mentioned that they are not a 2 a.m. bar, and with her attitude I could see why. The owner or manager came over a few minutes later and offered to buy us a shot for our troubles. At first we said no but then we were like screw it. I doubt I will give this place a second chance as it was obvious the waiters and waitresses did not want to serve us. They did wait on a table directly behind us and quickly got them menus and served them. Just overall crappy service.   \n",

I asked the cook to make it with Pam instead of butter and they willingly accommodated! This was great! Definitely recommend! The server (Matt!) was AWESOME! Come and visit--worth it!   \n",
       "31  I've heard a lot of rave reviews for the Kauai Chicken, so I had to try it for myself. I decided to do a takeout. It was Tuesday around 11:43a and had only 3 people there, two one one table and a single diner. I waited about 5 minutes then my order was ready. I couldn't wait till I got home, thinking about the great chicken I was going to devour. I got home and opened the cover and had 1 quarter piece and 1 thigh. Took a bite of the thigh and almost spit it out. The inside never look fresh and it was really oily. By oily, there was a ton of cooking oil at the bottom of the plate. I took a bite of the quarter piece .. the drumstick to be exact and it tasted the same. The meat fell off the bone, but it didn't taste freshly cooked. It looked like they fried the chicken ahead of time and then refrigerated it until someone ordered it, then put it in the fryer again. The color of the chicken meat wasn't white, it was a greyish color. I know my chicken and that chicken wasn't cooked fresh...   \n",

       "33             I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a Korean BBQ establishment before as I was with this place. \\n\\nFirst of all, the servers took forever to come take our orders and I thought it was a bit ridiculous that if one of us wanted to order the veggies, we all had to order it as well. \\n\\nSecondly, the grill that my friend and I were sharing wasn't working properly and it took them over half an hour to come fix/replace it. Oh, and if we wanted to order more side dishes or drinks, we had to literally wave and yell a server to come to our table.\\nThe food is subpar. Veggies were dry and wilted. The fish smelled a bit funny and the meats were overly seasoned.\\n\\nTo top it off, the route to the bathroom consisted of passing by meat just literally sitting in buckets of blood. I was so grossed out!\\n\\nAll in all, a pretty bad experience to say the least. Don't think I'll be going there again.\\n\\nPs, if you don't have cash or credit, don't even think of going into the place.   \n",

       "41  Om nom nom. Warm and full and happy. Came right before the lunch rush. We were one of two tables occupied. It started to fill up about midway into our lunch though. Service is efficient, but not in a brusque way. Fairly pleasant, actually. Interesting thing to note: chopsticks and spoons are self serve from a container at the table. The chopsticks are disposable, but the spoons are metal. Side note: If you sit at the booths close to the door and the door opens, it can get chilly (but it's alright if you have a piping hot stew in front of you).\\n\\nHad:\\n\\nBlack goat stew ($12) - single portion. Came with purple rice. Oddly enough, my rice came when they brought the banchan to the table (about 5-10 minutes before my stew came out). What that meant was that my rice got to cool down before my stew came. Not a good thing, but something I can live with because my stew was still boiling when it came to the table. Goat stew had a lot of bean sprouts in it. I thought there wasn't that much ...   \n",

It's not bad. First let me say if you want friendly service this place is probably not for you. If you want a good burger than your in luck. It's inexpensive and good. We sat on the street which was nice. The fries were a little spicy so if your stomach can't handle a little spice then avoid the fries. All in all, I give this place 3 flushes. The service could have been a little better.   \n",

       "48                     This Trader Joe's in particular is one of my favorites. It's never too crowded except around the holidays, I've never had to wait in line for more than 1 minute (someone always comes around to pull me over), all the cashiers are extra friendly, and the samples in the back keep my belly warm. WARNING THE PARKING will drive you crazy. Come at an odd hour to avoid the extremely stressful experience that is parking here. It's cramped, the spaces were made with ant-sized cars in mind, and you'll often have to wait for a spot by loitering in the middle of the whole lot and blocking people. Coming even a little later in the night will save you the hassle.\\n\\nTrader Joe's in general: Why must you package all your vegetables? Why do your herbs only come in small, plastic-wrapped bunches? \\n\\nMy favorites: a bag of four avocados for ~$2.50. Two salmon filets for ~$10.00. $3 wine, \"healthy\" (I'm not really sure, but the ingredients definitely read a little better) frozen food.   \n",
       "49  Went there early morning with few other families. Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they cannot serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift. We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items. So it turns out 90% of things we wanted to order were locked by manager. As we decided to leave another waiter (who was saw standing outside texting) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times. We called ihop and they did not have any wait time. At IHOP we were treated nicely and fresh pancakes, crepes, hash browns and eggs were served without much wait.

The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. \\nThe staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.\\nCaution: will smell like BBQ grill after.   \n",
       "2                            Was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here. All I can say is, I am coming back very soon.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nWasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food. Loved it!! Food came out within 10 min. \\n\\nFOOD\\nTried hamburger steak and it was so delicious. Gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! Also came with onion rings on top which I love. Chicken katsu was amazing! Chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it. Best chicken katsu I had. \\n\\nOVERALL\\nIt was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive. I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel. (They had other posters but Keali'i Reichel happens to be my favorite). Place is clean, service is fast and friendly and food is delicious. What more could you ask for?   \n",

More for couples than group gatherings.\\n\\nService: The ambience & food make up for this, which unfortunately for us, the service has been terrible. We have come fairly close to restaurant closing both times (within the hour), but they do close very early for Vegas. The staff makes it VERY clear that they want to go home right from the start in hurrying orders and are more aggressive as time goes on. Unfortunate.\\n\\nFood: Very good. A little salty on some items during our first visit but good overall and again, warrants the overall 3 stars. Steak. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Calamari. Cobb salad. etc.   \n",
       "4      Absolutely the WORST pool company that I have EVER had to deal with.  The customer service is horrible.  After leaving many messages over the course of a few weeks I was only able to contact them when I called them AGAIN.  I asked to speak with the actual pool tech who initially came to my house.  The RUDE lady on the phone told me that she was more than capable to answer my questions - about a pump that SHE HAS NOT SEEN, and about a conversation I had with the tech THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR.  \\n\\nI was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost...   \n",

       "15219  As locals we used  to the this place when it was still Todd English however since the new owners took over it has gone down hill fast!!  We have tried it 4 times now since it changed over and each time was disappointing.  The food is not very good at all anymore, most of the wines are gone and the prices seem to have increased.  This particular time we went to have dinner and watch the hockey game last week.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us.  After waiting for several minutes I finally ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered an iced tea.  By the way there were hardly any people in the bar or restaurant so they were not at all overly busy!! Then it was time to order food this is where it gets interesting.  I asked what was on the cheese plate and the bartender had to go find a sheet, when he came back he litter just read the sheet and had no idea what he was riding to us.  I regretfully ordered the cheese plate since nothing else ...   \n",

       "15219  As locals we used  to the this place when it was still Todd English however since the new owners took over it has gone down hill fast!!  We have tried it 4 times now since it changed over and each time was disappointing.  The food is not very good at all anymore, most of the wines are gone and the prices seem to have increased.  This particular time we went to have dinner and watch the hockey game last week.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us.  After waiting for several minutes I finally ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered an iced tea.  By the way there were hardly any people in the bar or restaurant so they were not at all overly busy!! Then it was time to order food this is where it gets interesting.  I asked what was on the cheese plate and the bartender had to go find a sheet, when he came back he litter just read the sheet and had no idea what he was riding to us.  I regretfully ordered the cheese plate since nothing else ...   \n",
