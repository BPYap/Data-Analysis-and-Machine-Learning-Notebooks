I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel. (They had other posters but Keali'i Reichel happens to be my favorite). Place is clean, service is fast and friendly and food is delicious. What more could you ask for?   \n",

More for couples than group gatherings.\\n\\nService: The ambience & food make up for this, which unfortunately for us, the service has been terrible. We have come fairly close to restaurant closing both times (within the hour), but they do close very early for Vegas. The staff makes it VERY clear that they want to go home right from the start in hurrying orders and are more aggressive as time goes on. Unfortunate.\\n\\nFood: Very good. A little salty on some items during our first visit but good overall and again, warrants the overall 3 stars. Steak. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Calamari. Cobb salad. etc.   \n",
       "4  Absolutely the WORST pool company that I have EVER had to deal with.  The customer service is horrible.  After leaving many messages over the course of a few weeks I was only able to contact them when I called them AGAIN.  I asked to speak with the actual pool tech who initially came to my house.  The RUDE lady on the phone told me that she was more than capable to answer my questions - about a pump that SHE HAS NOT SEEN, and about a conversation I had with the tech THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR.  \\n\\nI was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost...   \n",
